# Welcome to my Jammming App!

I am genuinely stoked to have managed to create and properly style (*I hope it was properly styled, at least*) this quite a challenge of an app **from the second attempt!**

## How to use it?

The procedure is simple:

1. When you load up the app, it will ask you to authorize your app to access your Spotify i order to be able to perform certain API-based functionalities, like fetching songs and uploading those to your custom playlist.

2. Type in your track -> you will automatically be fetching some results as you type!

*Note*: I did not implement the songs fetchig on search on purpose - it adds a little more real-time interactivity

3. Add your tracks to the custom plylist with the `+` icon (**You can actually add different songs if you re-type the song you are searching -> the playlist remains intact**)

4. Name your playlist above the added songs, and then hit *Save to Spotify* button

5. Check your Spotify -> you should see a new playlist appear! Yay :smile:

### What is required?

Just make sure you have an active Spotify account throught which you can grant permission for this app to perform the above-mentioned stuff.

### What software was used to create this little piece of digital magic?

- HTML
- Modular CSS
- JavaScript / React.js

## Extra feature: Recommendations

Now you can click on *Get recommendations* button on each song to get 5 recommendations based on the track per which you selext the recommendations. You can add those to your custom playlist with ease.

**Note:** Feel free to check out [this technical documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ake7TMQspqx74goV3vsVWndZeTeSIaE1xpVpq7Is3Y0/) relevant to the feature addition.


### How can I add comments for improving the app?

You can add them here in the comments on GitHub, or go to this [link here](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/my-jammming-project/810692) to post your reply.

Thanks for your time, and all the best in yuor coding ventures!
